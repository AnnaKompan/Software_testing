Unit Testing, Fuzz Testing, TBD, TDD

- [Lab 1](./Lab1) - Basic Unit Testing
- [Lab 2](./Lab2) - Advanced Unit Testing (Stub, Mock, Spy)
- [Lab 3](./Lab3) - Advanced Unit Testing (Parameterized test)
- [HW 2](./HW2) - TDD (Test Drive Development)

2. Stub, Mock, Spy - test doubles.

   **Stub** - to test that at such condition & parameters it returns value needed.
   
   **Mock** - imitating of real components behavior that can't be used for now (file that is currently unavailable)
   
   **Spy** - record interactions with the object (number of times called, return value, args passed during each invocation)
   
3. describe() - to organize and group related test cases into logical blocks.

HW2 - **TDD Loop** Red -> Green -> Refactor
- **R** - failing test
- **G** - just enough code to make test pass
- **R** - clean up code
