- [Lab 1](./lab_1) - Basic Unit Testing
- [Lab 2](./lab_2) - Advanced Unit Testing (Stub, Mock, Spy)
- [Lab 3](./lab_3) - Advanced Unit Testing (Parameterized test)
- [HW 2](./hw_2) - TDD (Test Drive Development)

1. Stub, Mock, Spy - test doubles.

   **Stub** - to test that at such condition & parameters it returns value needed.
   
   **Mock** - imitating of real components behavior that can't be used for now (file that is currently unavailable)
   
   **Spy** - record interactions with the object (number of times called, return value, args passed during each invocation)
